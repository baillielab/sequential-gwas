# UKB RAP

Most of the interactions with the UK Biobank RAP is made directly from your local machine using the dx-toolkit.

## Installing Dependencies

### DNA Nexus Toolkit

First, install the dx-toolkit on your local computer by following the instructions on [this page](https://documentation.dnanexus.com/downloads). You will also need to download the compiler.

For reference, a quickstart guide to the toolkit can also be found [here](https://documentation.dnanexus.com/getting-started/cli-quickstart).

### Cromwell (If you want to develop)

To run [WDL](https://openwdl.org/) workflows locally you will need [cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro/) as well. If you are planning to extend the capabilities of this package, [this page](https://github.com/dnanexus/dxCompiler/blob/develop/doc/ExpertOptions.md) will be of interest.

## Logging in

Then you need to login to your UKB RAP account using:

```bash
dx login
```

You will be prompted for your username and password.
