# Walk Through

In this section we discuss how to regenerate results from an analysis from scratch. Each step consists in a separate workflow for which a dedicated documentation is referenced. While workflows are platform agnostic, due to complex data permissions and governance, each workflow is typically run on a dedicated platform.

## Step 1: Aggregating Genetic Datasets

- workflow: [Combining GenOMICC Datasets](@ref)
- platform: [Working with ODAP](@ref)

## Step 2: Imputation of Genotypes

- workflow: [GenOMICC Genotypes Imputation](@ref)
- platform: [Eddie](https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/research-support/research-computing/ecdf/high-performance-computing)

## Step 3: Merging GenOMICC and the UK Biobank

- workflow: [Merging the GenOMICC and UK Biobank Cohorts](@ref)
- platform: [Working with the UKB RAP](@ref)

## Step 4: Analysis

- workflow: Todo
- platform: [Working with the UKB RAP](@ref)
