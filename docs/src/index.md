# GenOMICC Workflows

## Purpose

This [repository](https://github.com/baillielab/genomicc-workflows) provides a set of Nextflow workflows that can be used to analyse data generated by the GenOMICC project.

## Cohorts

Even though our main dataset consists of GenoMICC data, for historical reasons (COVID-19 pandemic), we have a total of 4 different cohorts: GenOMICC, MILD, REACT and ISARIC. MILD, REACT and ISARIC were integrated in order to provide non severe "controls" for various COVID-19 susceptibility studies.

### GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care)

- Link to the study webpage: [https://genomicc.org/](https://genomicc.org/).

#### GenOMICC UK

Inclusion criteria:

- Intensive Care Unit patients
- UK (mostly England and some specific recruitment centers if I understand correctly)

Additional Information:

- The study also seems to be recruiting controls by matching in some way according to [this page](https://register.genomicc.org/registration/Registration/Register/en).
- Nurses select who they think might be eligible which could produce cryptic bias as well.


#### GenOMICC International

This is still being deployed and is not part of our current data.

### ISARIC

Link to the study webpage: [https://isaric.org/](https://isaric.org/).

Inclusion criteria:

- Our subset of individuals all had Covid-19

Additional Information:

- The severity varies and a severity score is provided
- Many biological and contextual covariates exist but are sparse

### MILD

Link to the study webpage: ?

Inclusion criteria:

- Covid-19
- Volunteers (It is not clear in what way?)
- Not hospitalised 

### REACT (Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission)

- Link to the study webpage [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/).

Inclusion criteria:

- Covid-19
- It is unclear if they were hospitalised
- It is unclear what the selection process is

## Available Workflows

These workflows will typically be run sequentially.
